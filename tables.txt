This table claims includes:

claim_id: A unique identifier for each claim.
policy_id: Links the claim to a specific policy in the policies table.
user_id: Associates the claim with a specific user in the users table, allowing users to see their claims.
claim_type: Indicates the type of insurance for the claim (auto, health, rental), ensuring the claim is processed accordingly.
claim_status: Tracks the progress of the claim (e.g., submitted, under review, approved, rejected).
claim_amount: The amount the user is claiming.
approved_amount: The amount that has been approved for the claim, which could be less than or equal to the claimed amount depending on the review.
claim_date: The date the claim was filed.
review_date: The date the claim started being reviewed.
decision_date: The date a decision was made on the claim.
comments: Any comments or notes related to the claim, such as reasons for rejection or additional information requested.

Design Considerations
Foreign Keys: In the tables for specific policy types (Auto Insurance Policies, Health Insurance Policies, Rental Insurance Policies), the primary key also acts as a foreign key referencing the Policies table. This enforces a one-to-one relationship between a policy record and its detailed information in these tables.
CREATE TABLE claims (
    claim_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    policy_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    claim_type ENUM('auto', 'health', 'rental') NOT NULL,
    claim_status ENUM('submitted', 'under_review', 'approved', 'rejected') NOT NULL,
    claim_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    approved_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    claim_date DATE NOT NULL,
    review_date DATE,
    decision_date DATE,
    comments VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (claim_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (policy_id) REFERENCES policies(policy_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

Policy Types Enumeration: The policy_type column in the Policies table could be implemented as an ENUM if the number of policy types is known and relatively static. Otherwise, consider using a separate table to define policy types for greater flexibility.

Normalization: This schema design keeps the database normalized, which helps in maintaining data integrity and reduces redundancy. Each policy type has its own table for specific attributes, making the system scalable and easier to manage.

Many-to-One Relationship: The relationship between users and policies is many-to-one, where a user can have multiple policies. This is represented by the user_id foreign key in the Policies tabl
